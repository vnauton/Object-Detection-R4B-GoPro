# Object-Detection-R4B-GoPro
Inspired by Edje_electronics, this project use my Raspberry 4 Model B and my GoPro Hero7 Black in order to detect object using TensorFlow and OpenCV

In order to work on my Raspberry 4 Model B, I had to force install of OpenCV 3.4.6.27 and TensorFlow 1.14.0

The issue I solve are mentionned in the document ObjectDetection_instructions.ods (LibreOffice Calc).
